  <h2>Hi, I&rsquo;m Isaac Overacker.</h2>

<p>I write about software development, design, and related topics here.  I generally focus on iOS and iPhone development.  You can find me on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/ioveracker">@ioveracker</a> and GitHub as <a href="http://github.com/ioveracker">ioveracker</a>.</p>

<p>I co-founded <a href="http://arboreal.co">Arboreal</a> and developed <a href="http://listenlist.co">Listenlist</a> for the iPhone.  It&rsquo;s a great way to keep track of the music you discover.  I&rsquo;m also known to work on big enterprise software projects in the healthcare space using technologies like .NET and Oracle.  When I&rsquo;m not hacking on something, I like to spend time with my wife, play video games, and brew beer.</p>

<p>This blog is powered by the wonderful <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> platform and hosted by <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.  The theme is <a href="http://github.com/ioveracker/mnml">mnml</a>, my own fork of <a href="https://github.com/mjhea0/whiterspace">whiterspace</a> with a number of my own changes.  I write my posts in either <a href="http://mouapp.com">Mou</a> or good old <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> on OS X.</p>
