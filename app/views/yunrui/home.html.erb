<p>Welcome! I'm Yunrui Zhang, Software Engineer from San Francisco. </p>

<p> Right now I'm am passioate about Web Development, especially Ruby on Rails. But anything in the Computer Science field is my interest. I program and teach people Python, PHP, Java, C/C++, and cs conceptes in general. I am not religious about any language/frameworks, because I believe everyone has his/her own style of coding and every tool 
has it's purpose. </p>

<p>This is the place I share my programming experiences, and maybe my philosophies once in a while...</p>
